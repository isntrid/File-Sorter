# File-Sorter 📂

This program, when given appropriate permissions, can sort any number of files in any directory or folder of your choice into a, pre-existing or otherwise, folder by extension types (i.e. .exe, .pkg, .pdf).

You can use this program to quickly and easily sort your files instantly, sifting through any number of files rapidly.

You must run this program with read/write permissions for it to function.

## Features:
- Case-insensitive extension matching (i.e. 'HEIC' = 'heic')
- No reason to add a period infront of your inputs, you can simply type 'exe' or 'pdf'.
- Supports multiple file types at once.
- Automatically creates target folder if it doesn’t exist.
- Shows number of files moved.
